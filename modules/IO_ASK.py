group of Molecules that are all present in your system simultaneously. All
Design Molecules are automatically included, at least one Target Molecule must

is modified for the Design Group, with the options being:

2) maintain - make sure binding does not get worse than it was initially.
3) reduce - make sure binding does not improve over its initial value.

You now have the OPTION of specifying various types of structure restraints to
ensure that your system behaves how it should. Please note that this is an
expert-level application of the IPRO Suite. Due to their complexity, it is very
possible to cause significant problems in your experiment by creating
inappropriate restraints. Please use extreme caution and careful consideration.

You will have four options:
1) Permanently fixing Atoms in place. When you do this, those Atoms will never,
ever be modified by IPRO in any way.
2) Position restraints - make sure that one or more Atoms stay close to their
initial positions / structure
3) Distance restraints - restrain the distance between two Atoms
4) Dihedral restraints - restrain the dihedral angle formed by four Atoms
